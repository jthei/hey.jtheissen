    **Web Dev/Design Frameworks &amp; Tools**

    - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Cuts a couple weeks off of your design cycle and is pretty standardized as long as you stick to best practices. People should be able to understand and use your site at first glance rather than being lost.
    - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. Extensive Documentation on the site.
    - [SPServices](http://spservices.codeplex.com/) - Client-side SharePoint interaction with jQuery.
    - [repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/JavaScript) - An online environment for interactively exploring programming languages. It provides a fully-featured terminal emulator and code editor, powered by interpreter engines for more than 15 languages. I use it to test out Javascript functions on the fly, but it does so much more.
    - [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - The answer to every question you could ever hope to ask, especially in regards to web development.
    - [Github](https://github.com/) - GitHub is how people build software. A combination of social media network and version control system. Tons of code that is free to use (mostly) and learn from as well as hosting and maintaining your own projects.
    - [regex101](https://regex101.com/#javascript) - Regular Expression Tester, you should learn regular expressions regardless of what you do. It'll make you a better person.
    - [extendsclass](https://extendsclass.com/) - A collection of free developer tools: testers (RegEx, XPath, JSONPath, SQLite), data generators (CSV, JSON, SQL), diff (XML, JSON, CSV), code checkers (Python, PHP, Ruby).
